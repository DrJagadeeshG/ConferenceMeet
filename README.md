# 🤝 ConferenceMeet – EGU Abstract Matcher and Networking Tool

**ConferenceMeet** is a smart tool designed for academic conferences like the **EGU General Assembly**, where thousands of researchers submit abstracts and want to connect with peers working on similar topics. This project aims to simplify the **matchmaking process** by scraping all publicly available abstracts and using NLP-based similarity matching to help researchers find potential collaborators before or during the conference.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Scrapes up to **25,000 abstracts** directly from the EGU website.
- 🧠 Uses state-of-the-art **Sentence Transformers** for semantic matching.
- ⚡ Efficient search with **FAISS**, optimized for large datasets.
- 🖥️ **Streamlit** frontend for easy user interaction.
- 📝 Outputs include **title, abstract content, authors, affiliations, and similarity score**.
- 📤 JSON-based outputs for integration or sharing.

## 🧰 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/conferencemeet.git
cd conferencemeet
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Scrape Abstracts**

```bash
python Scraper/scrape.py
```

- Scrapes abstracts from:  
  `https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/EGU25-00001.html` → `EGU25-25000.html`
- Saves structured results into: `Data/abstracts.json`

---

### 2. **Generate Embeddings**

```bash
python Matcher/embed.py
```

- Loads `abstracts.json`
- Creates sentence embeddings using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Builds a **FAISS** index and saves it as `abstracts_index.faiss`

---

### 3. **Run the Matching App**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Enter your own **abstract title** and **abstract content**
- Finds and shows the **top 5 most similar abstracts** with:
  - Title
  - Authors
  - Affiliations
  - Abstract content
  - URL
  - Similarity score

---

## 🔎 Sample Usage

### User Input
> Title: **Smart Monitoring of Urban Floods Using IoT and AI**  
> Abstract: _This study introduces a hybrid AI system for detecting flood-prone zones in real time..._

### Output
```markdown
1. Flood Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Sensor Networks
   Authors: Dr. A. Kumar, Prof. L. Smith
   Affiliations: XYZ Institute of Hydrology
   Similarity Score: 0.8721
```
